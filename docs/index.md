# Collinearity
{: .fs-9 }

A set of exercises that explores the **Collinearity condition**; two fundamental equations, used in photogrammetry, to relate coordinates in a 2D sensor plane to 3D object coordinates.

The exercise traverses its use from single photo resection to space intersection and aims to highlight the foundational  aspect of the concept (and its application in 3D scene reconstruction). 

A very brief introduction to the Computer Vision concepts of Feature Matching, Disparity and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) are included to familiarize the user with the language (technical terms / jargon) and its similarities with traditional Photogrammetry.
